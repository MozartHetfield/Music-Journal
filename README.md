# Music journal
The final project of the course named Android Studio Fundamentals from the Google Digital Workshop organized in the University of Bucharest.

The application represents a journal that keeps the attended concerts of your lifetime, including few details and basic didactic features that helped us undestand better the presented concepts. The minimum API level is 8.0 and the targeted SDK is 28 (Android 9.0). The application won't run on smartphones with lower versions.

The main priciples and functionalities that were approached are: 

- Firebase storage and database for photos and classes
- Authentification with gmail account
- Camera integration/selection from gallery/background music
- Gradient animated background
- Navigation drawer
- Recycler view
- Card view
- Intents via Internet like share/maps/opening sites
- Custom activity transitions/fonts/themes

Special thanks to our teacher, Magda Miu, who has an unconditionally love to help people understand better Android.
The apk can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ew04x9jeslvc9sx/music-journal.apk?dl=0

Note: The background from the recycler view and from the concert management (the paper folding one) is too big and causes a bit of delay when switching or editing these activities.
