The application represents a journal that keeps the attended concerts of your lifetime, including few details and basic didactic features that helped us undestand better the presented concepts. The minimum API level is 8.0 and the targeted SDK is 28 (Android 9.0). The application won't run on smartphones with lower versions.

The main priciples and functionalities that were approached are: 

- Firebase storage and database for photos and classes

- Camera integration/selection from gallery/background music
